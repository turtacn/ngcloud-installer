# /etc/conf.d/udev-root: config file for udev-root

# We can create a /dev/root symbolic link to point to the root device in
# some situations. This is on by default because some software relies on
# it,. However, this software should be fixed to not do this.
# For more information, see
# https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=438380.
# If you are not using any affected software, you do not need this, so
# feel free to turn it off.
